I created this "mind map" to help me in case I get stuck during the OSCP exam.
This scheme is the way I normally think when I hack linux or windows machines. It's the approach I use for the OSCP lab, Hack The Box Lab and usually any Real-life machine.


Any suggestion is accepted in order to improve the map, change or add concepts.
